## Research Projects (Selective)

- **RISKA – Risk Stratification in Cardiology Using AI**  
  The RISKA project focuses on developing advanced AI models to enable early and individualized risk stratification in cardiology. The goal is to analyze ECG signals alongside clinical parameters to identify patients at elevated risk of severe cardiac events such as sudden cardiac arrest or worsening heart failure.  
  Research emphasis includes interpretable deep learning methods that clinicians can trust, bridging the gap between algorithmic performance and real-world applicability. The project is interdisciplinary, involving experts in cardiology, data science, and explainable AI (XAI).  
  **My role**: Development and training of AI models, implementation of explainability methods, and practical evaluation of the approaches in clinical contexts.

- **HERMIQS – Heart Emergency Rescue Management IQ System**  
  HERMIQS aims to improve emergency response workflows for cardiac incidents through intelligent systems. The project develops real-time, AI-powered tools to assist paramedics and physicians during pre-hospital and early in-hospital care.  
  Key research areas include the integration of wearable sensor data, decision support under time-critical conditions, and explainability of AI outputs in emergency contexts. The project explores how trustworthy AI can contribute to faster, more accurate diagnosis and better patient outcomes during the so-called "golden hour" of cardiac emergencies.  
  **My role**: Development and training of AI models for real-time analysis, integration of explainability methods, and evaluation of model performance in emergency decision-making scenarios.

- **Artificial Intelligence for Cardiology (KardioIQ)**  
  This overarching initiative consolidates several research efforts at Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen (THM) aimed at leveraging artificial intelligence for cardiological diagnostics and treatment planning.  
  Central research themes include deep learning for ECG classification, detection of structural cardiac anomalies, and the development of explainable AI techniques that support clinical decision-making. The work emphasizes reproducibility, ethical deployment, and translational impact in real clinical workflows.  
  **My role**: Design and implementation of AI pipelines, training of deep learning models on time series data, development of XAI techniques, and evaluation of their utility for clinical users.
